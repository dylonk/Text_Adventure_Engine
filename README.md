A project created for UNT CSCE 4901 and 4902 (Capstone), Magiquill is a site for both creating and playing text adventure games. Users can create and publish games using the built-in editor that makes it easy to create games. Users can play their own games, as well as any published games, either on the site's built-in game engine or on the downloadable, offline game engine.

Magiquill can be found at: https://magiquill.netlify.app

The offline game player for Windows can be downloaded at: https://github.com/dylonk/Text_Adventure_Engine/releases/download/v1.0.1/Text.Adventure.Electron.Setup.1.0.1.exe
